Notes
=====

Dichotamies
-----------
- Viscous vs Inviscid
- Internal vs External
- Compressaible vs Incompressible
  - Mach number
  - Speed of sound is important
- Laminar vs Turbulent
  - Reynolds Number
- Natural vs Forced
- Steady vs Unsteady
  - Should only handle steady problems
- Dimensionality

Fluid Properties
----------------
- Density
- Mean free path/continuum length
- Vapour pressure (cavitation)
- Internal Energy
- Compressaibility
- Speed of sound
- Viscosity (simple temperature correction model in book)
- Surface Energy
- Contact Angle

Euler Model
-----------
- Pressure Field(x, y, z, t)
- Velocity Field
- Acceleration field
- Steady -> no t
- Vector fields
- dP/dL * L 


General
-------
- Book notes importance of unit conversion.
- Head pressure in pipes is important.
- Figure out a good way of handling reference pressure. 
- Is pressure drop significant with respect to reference pressure?
- Rotation?
- HGL and EGL
